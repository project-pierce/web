## Description
Project Pierce presents many different food combinations from the Pierce Dining Hall at Stevens to express different creations that can be made at Pierce to help Stevens students enjoy their food to the fullest.
Students are also able to submit their own recipes and provide feedback on existing ones.
Recipes and foods are grouped into separate pages by meal of the day, such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Beverages, which can be changed through the use of the website's navbar.
