# Project Pierce
Project Pierce is a website project created with the intent of giving Stevens students the ability to review and create recipes based on foods offered at the Pierce dining hall.

## Future Modifications
- Add more details to each meal (vegan,halal,keto).
- Add more meals.
- Create post boxes for adding recipes instead.
