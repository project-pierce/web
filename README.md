# Project Pierce
Project Pierce is a website project created with the intent of giving Stevens students the ability to review and create recipes based on foods offered at the Pierce dining hall.

## Future Modifications
- For each meal page, give each recipe its own detail arrow which displays the name or picture of recipe and when the arrow is exapnded, shows either a larger image of the meal and/or steps/ingredients
